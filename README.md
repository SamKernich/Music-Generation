# Music-Generation
Music Generation using deep learning


In this project we will be using a DCGAN to generate music as a midi file. We are using pianoroll data from the LAKH midi dataset, and initially are only using the melodies (right hand) of each file to train the model and produce piano melodies. 

This project is conducted with Monash DeepNeuron and credit to Valerio Vadari for ideas and code with data processing. https://github.com/musikalkemist/generating-melodies-with-rnn-lstm/tree/master
